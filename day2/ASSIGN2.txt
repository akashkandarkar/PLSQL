Practice 1	
•Write a PL/SQL block that takes a department number from a user and increases the salary of all the employees belonging to the department by 10%. The block should display on the screen how many records are updated.




Practice 2

•	Write a PL/SQL block to display the employee first name, salary and JOB_TITLE for the first five employees recorded in the “employees” table by making use of :
•	Simple for loop with “EXIT WHEN” condition
•	The “WHILE” condition
•	Cursor FOR LOOP 

Practice 3

•	Write a PL/SQL block that displays names and salaries of all “Programmer” recorded in the employees table by making use of a cursor.

Practice 4

•	Write a PL/SQL block that accepts a value of a job_id from user and displays the full names, department numbers and salaries of the employees from the “employees” table having that job. The block makes use of a parameterized cursor. The user input is passed on to the cursor as a parameter. 
   	
Practice 5

•	Write a PL/SQL block that updates the salaries of the employees as per the following rules. 
•	If the job is SH_CLERKand department_id is 10 then increase the salary by 20%
•	If the job is ST_MAN and department_id is 20 then increase the salary by 5%
•	For all the other cases increase the salary by 10%
The block makes use of a cursor for performing the updates and ensures that the appropriate locks are taken on the data retrieved by the cursor, as the data is to be updated. 



Practice 6

•	Write a PL/SQL block that retrieves information from the “department” and “employees” table and displays it in the following format

Department ID :10		Department Name : XXXX
________________________________________________________
EMPLOYEE NUMBER 	 EMPLOYEE FULL NAME	SALARY  	JOB

XXXXXX		XXXXXX			XXXX		XXXXX
XXXXXX		XXXXXX			XXXX		XXXXX
.........

Department ID : 20		Department Name : XXXX
________________________________________________________
EMPLOYEE NUMBER 	 EMPLOYEE FULL NAME	SALARY  	JOB

XXXXXX		XXXXXX			XXXX		XXXXX
XXXXXX		XXXXXX			XXXX		XXXXX
.........

    ......and so on for all the departments recorded in the “department” table.
(Hint : Make use of two cursors –one to retrieve department details and another a parameterized cursor to retrieve employee details. In a loop, use a cursor to retrieve the department and the department name from the DEPARTMENT table, pass the department_id second  cursor to retrieve the required column values from the “EMPLOYEES” table, for those employees who work in that department.)
